# WL_RestEEG

This repo contains the Matlab scripts used to harmonise the EEG pre-processing across WL data collection sites.
It also contains the script used by all sites to generate the spectral power estimates using the pre-processed data.

## Organisation

The scripts are organised as follows:
1. Files specific to each site (i.e., processing script and accompanying electrode location files) are allocated into the relevant folder, these include:
    1. Helsinki
    2. McLean
    3. Stanford
    4. UCSD
2. Files used to generate parameters for analysis are in the "ParameterDerivation" Folder.
    1. Currently this only includes the spectral power estimates. 

## Notes:
1. These files are what I sent out to the individual sites. I do not know if they hade made adjustments after receiving them. While I expect that the processings steps are the same, file naming and other directory specific things might have changed. And so I imagine it's a good idea to check in with them accordingly.

### Other Notes
1. The test data are in various forms based on what was shared to me. There are some weird things about it from memory.
   1. Stanford was unable to share a trimmed raw file, so shared an existing .SET file (i.e., output from EEGLAB). This meant I had to work with them to get their import functions correct without directly being able to test it.
   2. McLean has two different test sets; not because they are different internally but due to file naming conventions. The example data has been renamed using a different naming convention and so might the naming of output files might be a bit strange.
3. The .ced files are electrode location files and contain 3-D co-ordinates that allow the electrodes to be mapped on the head.
    1. These are site specific and based on how the data are collected.
